# Imran-s-lil-macropad

Hiya! 
i'm Imran Ahhmed, and this is my Hack/MacroPad submission for the blueprint program

here, I made a macropad with the SEEED XIAO RP3040 DIP as the microcontroller, 2 MINI-LEDs, 7 Cherry MX switches n keycaps, and a EC11 rotary encoder switch.

Here, you can see the general view of the macropad:

I tried to keep everything minimal and simple, and I think i achieved it pretty well

Here's the schematic:

for the project, you'll need:
1x SEEED XIAO RP2040-DIP
1x EC11 Rotary encoder switch
4x 
2x SK6812 MINI-E LEDs
7x cherry MX swwitches
7x keycaps for the Cherry MX switches
